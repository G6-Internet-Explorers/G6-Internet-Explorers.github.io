										<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
										<p style="text-align:justify">This project explores the suitability of harnessing existing RFID technologies to keep better track of passengers disembarking and embarking commercial dive and snorkel boats, assisting in safeguarding human life, by reducing the possibility of someone being left behind in open water. RFID technologies using “Gates” and simple waterproof wristbands are currently used in water parks in America primarily to allow parents to keep track of their wide roaming children. As the child goes from one slide to another or to a pool they pass by RFID readers which record the tag. Software in the main office matches a tag to a reader location and parents are able to access a kiosk which will display a map of the park and the last gate the child passed through.
											<br>
											<br>
										The need for a solution clearly exists as was highlighted by a recent article published on the ABC Far North website on 20 May 2018 by Anna Hartley, which details the use of handprints to identify passengers and reduce the risk of someone being left behind. A prototype featuring palm vein authentication technology from Fujitsu was recently tested here in Queensland. This approach requires the development of new hardware and software which will make it more expensive to implement and take longer to deploy.</p>
										<p style="text-align:justify"> Palm reading is an interesting approach when considering that divers entering the water are likely already kitted up including gloves to protect the hands against coral scratches. The new technology, would require the gloves to be removed prior to scanning - both on entry and exit of the water. I expect there would be some pushback both from operators and tourists on this inconvenience and inefficiency.
										</p>
										
										<h2>Motivation</h2>
											<p style="text-align:justify">
												This project is about safeguarding human life, by making it less likely that a person will be left in the open water by a departing boat. Secondary but still a motivating factor is the prevention of industry and tourism losses such as those that followed the tragic case of the Lonergan’s in 1998, with the subsequent media frenzy and movie. While the Queensland government did subsequently introduce changes to regulations which should have prevented a further “left behind” scenario, in 2011 a diver surfaced to find that his tour boat had moved away from his location. Fortunately for him another tour boat was visiting the same reef and he was able to swim to it. A crew member conducting the head count had apparently broken the rules which is why the vessel left the dive site without the full complement of passengers. Human error is still possible, but with an additional source of onboard passenger numbers, discrepancies can be dealt with speedily and everyone can go home safely.
											</p>

										<h2>Description</h2>
											<p style="text-align:justify">
												Commercial dive and snorkel tour operators are required by legislation to perform head counts of passengers on board prior to moving from a dive/snorkel site, where passengers have entered the water. This is to ensure that everyone who should be aboard the vessel is accounted for. Headcounts are typically conducted by crew using a manual clicker, a small handheld device that records a count of one each time the lever is pushed. A public announcement is made requesting all passengers refrain from moving about while the count takes place to reduce the likelihood of an incorrect count which would require a full re-count.</p>
												<p style="text-align:justify">
												This project would use existing technologies, proven effective in water parks to track visitors. At check-in, each passenger, including those do not expecting to go in the water would be provided an RFID wristband. The wristband tag would be recorded against the passenger profile by swiping the wristband to a RFID reader. This will ensure that should they decide later to go snorkelling or diving they have a wristband and will also allow an accurate count of all passengers onboard. RFID readers would be located at each point of disembarkation and would record the tag number of passengers exiting the vessel. To reduce waste the project calls for the wristbands to be re-usable and would be collected by crew as the passengers depart the boat back at port.</p>
												<p style="text-align:justify">
												As passengers board the vessel initially, the system would record them as being aboard and provide an additional source of information for the captain and crew. It is expected that a manual count would still be conducted. As passengers enter the water by passing through a port equipped with a reader the system will record their departure from the vessel. Similarly, on their return they are marked as being aboard. A crew accessible computer will be able to show, updated in real time, who is in the water. Not just the number of passengers but which individuals specifically. In the event that not everyone is accounted for prior to the vessel changing locations, crew will have a better understanding of the person or persons they are looking for and if they are part of a larger family or group. </p>
												<p style="text-align:justify">
												The wristbands also lend themselves to the introduction of cashless purchases from food and beverage outlets on the boat or if they decide to upgrade their tour package or purchase additional products. Point of Sale systems could use the RFID tag to identify passengers and allow them to run up a tab to be settled on departure, which would make it convenient for passengers kitted up in wet or stinger suits, which don’t tend to have pockets for wallets in them. With the re-usable wristbands being collected prior to the passengers leaving the boat it would be easy to check if there are still any monies owed and follow up with those individuals.
											</p>
												
										<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
										<div class="row">
												<ul>
													<li>Marine quality RFID readers will be required for each water access point as well as the check-in counter.</li>
													<li>These can be hardwired or wireless, although the preference would be for wireless.</li>
													<li>Each passenger will need to be provided with an RFID bracelet on check-in.</li>
													<li>Software to record the RFID tag # against passengers checking-in will be required.</li>
													<li>Software to show the status – OnBoard or OffBoard of each passenger will be required on the vessel.</li>
													<li>Point of Sale software may require modification to attribute a tag number to a tab account if this feature is desired.</li>
													<li>An interface, by way of web service will need to be developed for each tour operator reservation software to match a passenger to an RFID tag.</li>
													<li>A laptop computer.</li>
													<li>A wireless network on the vessel.</li>
												</ul>
											</div>

										<h2>Skills Required</h2>
											<p style="text-align:justify">
												Based on a webservice created for a skydiving operation that sent a passenger name and identifier from the reservation system to a video catalogue system, I estimate software development for a webservice to be measurable in days. Software to provide an easy to read GUI showing passenger status based on the RFID information, should take no more than a month to complete. While RFID readers of a quality able to stand up to conditions on an ocean going vessel appear to be plentiful and commercially available, further research will be required to determine if the readers have sufficient range to span the whole entry/exit port of the vessel. RFID technology is also used for shipping containers and as such there is an expectation that suitable devices will be available. Re-usable RFID wristbands are commercially available.
											</p>

										<h2>Funding</h2>
											<p style="text-align:justify">
												Commercial operations will be reluctant to invest in any new systems unless regulated to do so. With this in mind the project proposes the creation of a not for profit organisation to develop and deploy this technology. Funded initially by Government grant with ongoing revenue streams generated by the introduction of a small levy paid by tourists, similar to the levy collected for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Operators would sign up to the program and be provided with the appropriate technology and agree to collect the levy. Ownership of all equipment and intellectual property would remain with the not for profit. Some form of marketable logo and strategy could be used to coerce businesses into signing up as they could advertise to potential passengers that they have this extra safeguard.
											</p>

										<h2>Outcome</h2>
											<p style="text-align:justify">
												As stated in the overview this project seeks to provide an additional safeguard for visitors to our Great Barrier Reef. The success of the project will be by ensuring no snorkeler or diver is left in the open water by a commercial dive boat ever again. Even after stricter regulations were imposed on the industry by Government, human error allowed a situation to arise that may well have had tragic repercussions. The technologies discussed in the previous paragraphs will help to mitigate this human error and allow visitors and tourists to have more confidence in the industry and its safety record.
