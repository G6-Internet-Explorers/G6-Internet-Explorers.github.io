							<h3>Shane</h3>
							<p>G'day, My name is Shane Thacker, and my current home is Toowoomba Queensland.
								My RMIT student number is s3827970 and my email is thacker.shane@gmail.com Team Name: G6 Internet Explorers
								Born in Adelaide, I moved to Queensland when I was eighteen, where I got a job in the
								furniture industry. By twenty, I was going back and forth to Indonesia to train the
								suppliers on how to sand, prepare, upholster, assemble, glaze and upholster furniture
								for the Australian company I was working for. At twenty-one, I made the permanent move
								to Indonesia working for that company then eventually by the time I was twenty-two
								started my own teak outdoor furniture company. After the 2008 global crisis wiped out my
								customers, then me off the map, I worked for a European company managing their
								properties in Indonesia. When those properties were sold off in 2015, I joined an
								international school and became the school director.
								My main interests are barbeque low and slow and fishing, both of which involve knocking
								back a few cold beers. I have three kids the youngest being six and extremely naughty,
								most likely because he is too spoilt. Flight simulation is my main “do on own” hobby,
								but I rarely find time these days.
								I am working towards a bachelor of international business where I hope to move into a
								management position of an international company within the next five years.</p>
